This program controls the HP/Agilent 66309, 66311, 66319, and 66321 instruments.

The program is unfinished, but works well enough for my use on a 66309D. It's only been
tested on that particular model, and probably will not work on other models.

For the moment, I'm putting it on GitHub mostly as a backup copy of the code. That said, I hereby license it under the GPLv3.

The interface is very similar to that of the Agilent 14565B software.

The software is written using Microsoft .Net and communicates with the instrument using the IVI Visa COM library. I'm using the National Instruments VISA/GPIB drivers under Windows 10.
